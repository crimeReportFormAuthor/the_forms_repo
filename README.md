# the_forms_repo
A couple of different forms used to report crimes.  It was inspired by this post https://pvcycling.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/your-ride-didnt-change-anything/

Downloadng from github may be new to you.  Please visit https://github.com/crimeReportFormAuthor/the_forms_repo/wiki/How-to-Download-the-Forms for download instructions.  It's easy.

The intention is the forms be Free.  Free to use and Free to modify and Free to reuse.  Copyright information is on the wiki. https://github.com/crimeReportFormAuthor/the_forms_repo/wiki

I welcome changes.  Download the .odt file and change it.  Submit the changes as a ticket with an .odt attached.  If I like it, I'll post it as long as you agree to the Share and Share alike copyright license.

Safe bicycling to all.
