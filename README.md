# the_forms_repo
A couple of different forms used to report crimes.  It was inspired by this post https://pvcycling.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/your-ride-didnt-change-anything/

All the forms are licensed GPLv3. The point is they are meant to be Free.  
Copyright for the .txt files probably goes to the original author, Seth at https://pvcycling.wordpress.com/
Copyright for the .pdf file belongs to the author.  The author is the creator of this repository.  
The document is licensed under Creative Commons, Share and Share alike. 
The complete copyright license is here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/legalcode

If you find the form lacking in some way, please, by all means, edit it then open a ticket.  I only accept .txt and .odf.  If I like it, I'll add it to the repo.  I can make the PDF easily enough.
