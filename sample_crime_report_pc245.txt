File No.:

On Monday, 16 May, 2016 at 12:51 PM I, ###, was riding my bicycle in the City of Palos Verdes Estates with a group of cyclists. The group consisted of me, Witness Robert ###, Witness April ###, Witness Monica ###, Witness Sebastian ###, and Witness Gordon ###.

We had just left the Yellow Vase Cafe in Malaga Cove Plaza, heading north out of the plaza’s parking area. The group was riding in a single file and obeying all traffic laws. I was in the lead. Our intended route was a right turn onto Palos Verdes Drive West, continuing to Palos Verdes Drive in the direction of Redondo Beach.

On reaching the intersection with Palos Verdes Drive West from Malaga Cove, I stopped and looked for a break in the traffic so that I could safely proceed. A Mini Cooper was approaching the intersection at Via Corta from Palos Verdes Drive West. It had not quite reached the stop sign, therefore I deemed it safe to proceed out of the parking area.

I turned right as did W/Robert ####, who then immediately passed me on my left side. Seconds after making the turn I heard the high pitched whine of a motor vehicle accelerating quickly and then the sound of a car horn. I turned to my left and saw a yellow McLaren sports car behind me. I raised my left arm and waved, indicating to the driver that I was aware of the Suspect. Witness Monica ### reported that the Suspect had turned right onto Palos Verdes Drive West from Via Corta.

I then proceeded forward and prepared to move left in the lane so that I could proceed through the intersection bearing left toward Redondo Beach. At this point the road is a single lane. Although I was still in the right-hand portion of the lane, the Suspect purposely drew alongside me although there was no safe space adjacent to me, and although the Suspect had ample space to proceed without veering towards me.

The Suspect slowed to my speed, veered towards me and continued to slow down. It was clear to me that the Suspect intended to hit me. Fortunately I was able to hit my brakes and stop at the far right road edge at the intersection of Via Chico. Had I maintained speed and continued along a straight path the Suspect would have struck me, as the Suspect clearly intended to do. There was no reason for the Suspect to veer towards me. There were no obstacles in the Suspect’s path, the roadway was entirely clear leading towards Palos Verdes Boulevard, and there were no other vehicles impeding his forward movement.

After I had avoided his attempt to strike me, the Suspect, a male, leaned across what appeared to be his female passenger and raised his fist at me. Because the crime happened quickly and the car was low to the ground, I was unable to clearly identify the Suspect or his passenger. The Suspect then sped off in the direction of Redondo Beach.

Witness Robert ### was well ahead by this time and did not stop, but reported to me that the Suspect passed him quickly and exceedingly close as he rounded the bend at the intersection of PV Drive West & North. The other riders with me, Witnesses April ###, Monica ###, Sebastian ###, and Gordon ### were witnesses to the event.

It was clear that the Suspect, whose California license plate number was MRHVAC1, purposely veered with the intent to strike me with his a vehicle, a violation of Cal. Penal Code 245. A vehicle is a deadly weapon for purposes of this law. See People v. Golde, 163 Cal.App.4th 101, People v. Russell 129 Cal.App.4th 776, People v. Wright 100 Cal.App.4th 703. Had I not braked and brought my bicycle to the curb in an emergency maneuver the Suspect would have struck me with his vehicle, as he planned to do.

Attached is a plot of my course as recorded by my onboard bicycle computer, a Garmin 510.
